# Overview

This is a data analysis program. It analyzes the Netflix Movie Rating Dataset which is an extract of the real dataset that was used in 2009 in a $1,000,000 prize competition for the best user rating prediction algorithm.

The purpose of this program is to answer 3 questions explained below that will help us reach a conclusion for this specific dataset.

# Data Analysis Results

1. What is the number of movies that were analyzed for each year?
- The number of movies were counted for each year and displayed next to each other.
2. What can be concluded from visualizing the results in a graph? 
- Two ghraphs indicated that there was a possible relationship between the years and the count. The relationship could not be stablished with those graphs.
3. Upon further visualization, what type of relationship exists between the years and the number of movies?
- The relationship between the number of movies analyzed and years is a **linear relationship**.
